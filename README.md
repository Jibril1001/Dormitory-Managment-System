# Dormitory Management System

## About
This is my **first ever project**, built using **C++**. The purpose of this project is to manage student records in a dormitory, including adding, removing, searching, and displaying students. It also uses **file handling** to store student data persistently.

## Features
- Add a student with an ID, name, and room number.
- Remove a student by ID.
- Search for a student by ID.
- Display all registered students.
- Data is saved to a file (`students.txt`) for persistence.

## How to Run
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++):
   ```sh
   g++ dormitory_management.cpp -o dormitory
   ```
2. Run the executable:
   ```sh
   ./dormitory
   ```
3. Follow the on-screen menu to manage student records.

## What I Learned
- **Basic C++ syntax**: Using structs, functions, and file handling.
- **Working with files**: Storing and retrieving student data.
- **Vector operations**: Adding, removing, and iterating over a dynamic list.
- **User input handling**: Taking structured input and processing it.

This project marks the beginning of my coding journey, and I plan to improve it by adding more features in the future!
